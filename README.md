# üßê Project philosophy

- Jobly is a full stack javascript app that allows users to signup or login and view a wide variety of (fake) job listings from (fake) companies. 
- Users can search for companies or jobs based on key words and can apply to jobs if they are authenticated. 

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- This project uses the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime coupled with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- For the front end the app uses React.js functional components and hooks to handle state, make API calls, and handle events.
